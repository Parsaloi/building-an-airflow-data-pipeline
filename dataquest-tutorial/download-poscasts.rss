Today we&#8217;ll hear from a handful of artificial intelligence true believers who think a revolution is inevitable and are preparing for a future — and economy — that looks radically different than the one we now live in.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The shares of multiple regional banks slid today amid new tremors in the industry following the collapse of First Republic. But bank failures and consolidation are actually somewhat normal. So what&#8217;s a regional bank to do? And what are investors and depositors to make of all this? Then, how JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon became a banking industry heavyweight and why a bump in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage seems unlikely right now.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Political squabbling about raising the debt limit is well underway. But to meaningfully address federal debts and yearly deficits would require big actions. Elected officials could raise taxes and chip away at things like defense spending, Social Security and Medicare — but doing so isn&#8217;t popular. We&#8217;ll also dig into coal&#8217;s decline, investment in technical training and Britain’s new trade deal.</p>

We&#8217;ll ask about data he&#8217;s watching closely and the central bank&#8217;s messaging challenges ahead of its rate decision. Later, Reddit rethinks data access and California utility companies rethink how they charge for power.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Financial conditions&#8221; influence the cost of money, and they&#8217;re being made much more complicated by recent bank collapses. Today, we&#8217;ll delve into how tightening financial conditions influence the Federal Reserve&#8217;s next moves and could make it harder for small businesses and consumers to get loans. Plus, why COVID may have fundamentally reshaped how we spend and what the Silicon Valley Bank collapse means for venture capital.</p>

Though the Swiss bank&#8217;s problems predate the recent U.S. bank failures, some economists are asking whether the malady at Credit Suisse can or will infect the rest of global finance. We&#8217;ll also take a closer look at the role of regional banks and the communication tactics some are using to quell customer anxieties.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a running assumption that a strong labor market and wage growth will make it harder to slow rising prices. But how much does wage growth need to slow to get us to normal levels of inflation? Today, we&#8217;ll do the numbers on what economists say is ideal wage growth.

Sales at restaurants and bars are up nearly 25% since last January, but that spending surge coincides with dimming consumer confidence. What can all that going out tell us about the economy more broadly?
